            <p>Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. 
                The ability to learn is possessed by <br> humans, animals, and some machines; is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. <br>
                Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and
                 knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. <br> The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, 
                and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.</p>
